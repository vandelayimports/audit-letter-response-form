        <h1>Audit Letter Response:</h1>
        <p><span class="auditfirm"></span></p>
        <p></p>

        <p>By letter dated <span class="date1"></span>, which we recieved on <span class="date2"></span> <span class="client"></span>, <span class="title"></span>, <span class="company"></span>(<span class="short"></span>) requested that we furnish certain information to you in connection with your examination of the financial statements of <span class="short"></span> as of <span class="date3"></span>. While this firm represents <span class="short"></span> on a regular basis, our engagement is limited to specific matters concerning <span class="short"></span> on which we are consulted.</p>

      <p>To the extent the letter of request seeks information about unasserted claims or assessments, we have a policy against responding, directly or indirectly, regarding unasserted claims and assessments except to the extent they have been disclosed to the auditors by our client and specifically described in the letter of request. In this case, the letter of request does not specifically describe any such claims. Accordingly, we decline to respond regarding unasserted claims</p>

      <p>Subject to the foregoing and to the last paragraph of this letter regarding general limitations on this response, we advise you that as of <span class="date3"></span> we were not engaged to give substantive attention to, or to represent <span class="short"></span> in connection with, loss contingencies within the scope of Clause (a) of Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Policy Regarding Lawyers’ Responses to Auditors’ Requests for Information (the Statement), nor have we been engaged with respect to any such matter since that time up to the effective date of this response.  The effective date of this response is <span class="date4"></span>, the date on which we completed our internal review procedures for purposes of preparing this response, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of changes which thereafter may be brought to our attention.</p>
      
      <p>This letter and the opinions expressed in it are solely for your information in connection with your audit of <span class="short"></span> for the period specified in this letter.  This letter may not be quoted or otherwise referred to, in whole or in part, in any financial statement or document or furnished to any other person or agency without our prior written consent.  In addition, we understand that by making the request set forth in its letter to us, <span class="short"></span> does not intend to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to any information <span class="short"></span> has furnished to us.  Moreover, our response to you should not be construed in any way to constitute a waiver of the protection of the attorney work-product privilege with respect to any of our files involving <span class="short"></span>.</p>

      <p>This response is limited by and in accordance with the Statement and accompanying commentary (which is an integral part of the Statement).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the limitations set forth in the Statement regarding the scope and use of this response (paragraphs 2 and 7) are specifically incorporated herein by reference, and any description herein of any “loss contingencies” is qualified in its entirety by paragraph 5 of the Statement.  Consistent with paragraph 6 of the Statement and pursuant to <span class="short"></span>'s request, this will confirm as correct the [Shorthand Name of Audited Entity]’s understanding as set forth in its audit inquiry letter to us that whenever, in the course of performing legal services for <span class="short"></span>, we form a professional conclusion that <span class="short"></span> must disclose or consider disclosing a matter recognized to involve an unasserted possible claim or assessment, we will advise <span class="short"></span> and will consult with <span class="short"></span> concerning the question of such disclosure and the applicable requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 450.</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p><span class="attorney"></span></p>
